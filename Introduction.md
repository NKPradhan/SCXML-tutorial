**Basic State Machine Notation**

The most basic state machine concepts are \<state\>, \<transition\> and event. Each state contains a set of transitions that define how it reacts to events. Events can be generated by the state machine itself or by external entities. In a traditional state machine, the machine is always in a single state. This state is called the active state. When an event occurs, the state machine checks the transitions that are defined in the active state. If it finds one that matches the event, it moves from the active state to the state specified by the transition (called the "target" of the transition.) Thus the target state becomes the new active state.
